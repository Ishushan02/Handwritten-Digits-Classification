# Handwritten-Digits-Classification
This Repository contains a Tensorflow deployment of Handwritten Digit classification. I have trained the model on Mnist Handwritten dataset. To use the image in tensorflow_Js the image is converted to Sprite Sheet. The model is than deployed on the web browser and to predict the accuracy of the model we can draw the hand written digits on the screen and classify it.
